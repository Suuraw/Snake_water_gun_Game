This is the first time I m actually able to push a repository properly to my GitHub id with a decent knowledge of how things work like 'using comit','creating a new repository' or what does README is for ,so in short it was new and interesting for me.
This repo contains a simple snake-gun-water game written in JavaScript were the user interacts with a mini window on a browser inorder to play the game.
Desription: The game is between user and computer,were computer randomly takes gun,water or snake whereas user pick any and see if his pick defeats the pick of the computer.
For example: user-Snake ,computer-gun: result: computer WINS (vice-versa)
             user-water ,computer-gun: result: user WINS 
             user-Snake, computer-water: result:  user WINS (as snake drinks water)
