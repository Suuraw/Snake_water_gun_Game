This is the first time I m actually able to push a repository properly to my GitHut id with the decent knowing how the different functionality like 'using comit','creating a new repository' 
works or what does README is for so in short it was new and exciting for me.
This repo contains a simple snake-gun-water game written in JavaScript were the user interacts with a mini window on a browser to play the game.
Desription: The game is between user and computer,were computer randomly takes gun,water,snake whereas user pick any and see if his pick defeats the pick of the computer.
For example: user-Snake ,computer-gun: result: computer WINS (vice-versa)
             user-water ,computer-gun: result: user WINS 
             user-Snake, computer-water: result:  user WINS (as snake drinks water)
